                <p>Chennai’s robotics presence within the IT sector is steadily growing, supported by the city’s strong engineering talent, established tech parks, and increasing government focus on deep-tech innovation. The ecosystem combines IT expertise with advanced hardware development, allowing robotics companies to design automation solutions for manufacturing, industrial operations, and AI-driven systems. Several Chennai-based deep-tech firms and startups are working on industrial robots, underwater robots, humanoid systems, and automation accessories, which highlights the city’s shift from traditional IT services toward high-technology product development. Global companies have also begun setting up manufacturing units around Chennai because of its skilled workforce and affordable production environment, further strengthening the supply chain for robot components and peripherals.

                    The IT sector plays a major role by providing software, AI, cloud computing, and data analytics support for robotics, enabling companies to build smarter robots with better control systems and automation capabilities. With the presence of large tech parks like TIDEL Park and International Tech Park (ITPC), robotics startups gain access to infrastructure, incubation support, and professional networks. Chennai’s strong academic institutions further contribute by producing trained engineers in electronics, mechanical systems, embedded systems, and programming, which helps maintain a continuous talent pipeline. Although challenges such as high investment requirements and the need for specialized robotics skills remain, the overall trend shows that Chennai is becoming a promising hub for robotics innovation within the IT and industrial automation sector.</p>
